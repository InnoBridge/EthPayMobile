# EthPay Mobile App

Payment system developed by InnoBridge for the 2024 ETHToronto Hackathon.

## Installation

- Start by installing the latest version of Node.js for your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).
    - Once you have completed the installation, verify that it has been installed correctly by opening your command prompt (search ```cmd``` in your computer) and running ```node -v```. You should see the version number appear.
- Next install the latest version of git for your system (https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    - Once you have completed the installation, verify that it has been installed correctly by opening your command prompt and running ```git -v```. You should see the version number appear.
- Now it's time to clone the repo. In your command prompt, navigate to the documents folder (run ```cd documents```) then run ```git clone https://github.com/InnoBridge/EthPayMobile.git```. There should now be a new folder in your documents folder named "EthPay-Mobile-App".
- Next, install Expo on your mobile device (should be the first result in the app store or play store).
- In VSCode, open the EthPay-Mobile-App project. Then, in the top left, click "Terminal" and then "New Terminal". In the terminal that pops up, run ```npm i```. Once that has completed, run ```npm run start```. A QR code should appear in your terminal.
- Finally, open Expo on your phone. At this point, you may or may not need to create an account. Once you have done that, click "Scan QR code" in expo. Scan the QR code in your terminal. This should open the EthPay App in your phone (right now it's a blank screen that says "EthPay App By InnoBridge").
